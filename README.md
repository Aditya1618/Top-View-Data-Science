Introduction to Data Science , What ?, Why?, How!, Tools, Skills, Application In Data Science.
The main Goal in Data Science is to find Gold (value) from data.
Answering What, Why , How in data science.
# Why?
  ans-> Beacuse it solve three common Problems
      -Making Better decisions
      -Create Smart products
      -Automating manual Processes.
    Making Better Decisions ->
    Lets say we want to launch a Product or Create a Product. Some people are against the proporsal and some of them supports it.
    How to make decision in this kind of situation.The Classic way is not efficient as it should be. But Data Science see this problem
    in a different way. By Analysing the Facts from data we can take decisions.
    There is a structured way in DS which is more efficient, transparent, can be used again and again.
    1> Ask Question.
    2> Form a Hypothesis.
    3> Design an experiment.
    4> Collect the data.
    5> Analyze the data.
    6> Draw a Conclusion.
    7> Take actions.
    This above process can be termed as DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING.
    Application -> Customer Segmentation, Predicting churn, Sentiment Analysis, Portfolio Management.
    Create Smart Products.->
    User demands intelligent Products that solve/serve user in easy and efficient ways.To build smart sys we use.
    1> Machine Learning (machines learn from data)
    2> Anticipatory design (Antisipate user needs)
    3> Telemetry data (understand user behievour, preferences etc).
    Applications -> Voice Command , Face Recognition, Scheduling learning, Content Recommendation, Customer insight.
    Automate manual Process.
    Doing a job which is not challenging rather then Boaring , Time Consuming etc. is not a efficitive use of Humans.
    Therefore, the best solutions would be Automate those Jobs. Now with the help of (AI, ML , DL) it is possiable.
    Benefits of automation in terms of cost , better human resource allocations ,less prone to defects.
    Application -> Detection of fraud , providing support, Controlling Quality.
